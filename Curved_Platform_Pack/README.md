# Curved Platform/Platform Block Rail Model Pack
This resource pack adds NTE/MTR 4 Rail Model which replicates MTR's built-in platform block model.  
This allows for a visually curved/sloped platform depending on how the track is placed.

## Contents
This pack contains the following platform block model:
- Hong Kong (HK)
- With Platform Screen Doors (PSD)
- With Automatic Platform Gates (APG)
- North America Yellow (NA1)
- North America Black (NA2)
- United Kingdom (UK)

## Compatibility
This pack requires the [Nemo Transit Expansion](https://modrinth.com/mod/mtr-nte) mod on MTR 3, but loads directly in MTR 4 without additional dependencies/mods.

Platform can be flipped by right clicking with brush in MTR 3 + NTE
